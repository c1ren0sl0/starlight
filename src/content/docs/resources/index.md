description: Structural layers that anchor 6pointco analysis to institutional reality.
---

Resources consolidates two structural layers that anchor 6pointco analysis to institutional reality: the entities that constitute the federal technology ecosystem, and the primary evidence that documents their behavior and authority.

## Profiles

Profiles provide structural summaries of institutional entities referenced throughout 6pointco analysis. They describe organizational position, mandate scope, budget authority structure, and relevant taxonomy intersections. Profiles are descriptive — they establish structural context. Analytical conclusions about institutional behavior live under the relevant Perspective, not here.

### Institutional Profiles

Departments, bureaus and components, and programs and initiatives — organized by the formal structure of federal government. Each profile maps an entity's position in the institutional hierarchy, its mandate scope, and the technology domains and life-cycle functions most relevant to its operations.

### Market & Budget Profiles

Vendors, treasury accounts, and major enacted legislation — organized by their structural role in the federal technology ecosystem. Vendor profiles reflect durable market characteristics. Account profiles map formal budgetary structure. Legislation profiles document the authority architecture of enacted law.

## Sources

Sources are the primary evidence artifacts that ground 6pointco analysis. Enacted authority, budget data, oversight findings, and execution documentation — these are the evidentiary inputs from which structural interpretation is derived.

### Source Types

**Appropriations Acts** — Enacted annual or supplemental funding legislation establishing discretionary authority.

**Continuing Resolutions** — Temporary funding measures maintaining prior-year authority levels.

**Reconciliation Legislation** — Enacted mandatory spending measures operating outside the annual appropriations cycle.

**Budget Requests** — Executive branch proposals submitted to Congress. These document intent — not enacted authority.

**Oversight Reports** — Inspector General audits, GAO reports, and congressional oversight findings documenting institutional performance and risk.

**Execution Reports** — Agency performance data, IT Dashboard submissions, CPIC documentation, and financial execution records.

**Financial Statements** — Audited agency financial statements documenting actual expenditure and obligation patterns.
