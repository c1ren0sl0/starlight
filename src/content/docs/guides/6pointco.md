6point.co is a technology consultancy focused on building modern web applications and cloud infrastructure.

## What We Do

We help organizations design, build, and ship software using modern tools and platforms. Our work spans:

- **Web Applications** — Fast, accessible sites built with frameworks like Astro
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — Deployment and hosting on platforms like Cloudflare
- **Technical Strategy** — Guiding teams on architecture, tooling, and workflow

## Our Approach

We believe in keeping things simple. Ship fast, iterate often, and use the right tool for the job — not the most complex one.
