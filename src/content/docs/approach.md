## The Problem

Federal technology is typically understood in fragments.

Agency profiles describe structure but not behavior. Contract databases show awards but not constraint. Policy commentary highlights rhetoric but not enacted authority. Technology analysis focuses on tools but not funding mechanics.

These fragments are not wrong individually. But they are insufficient for decisions that depend on how the system actually operates.

There is a second problem. Much of the paid content available to federal technology leaders — the analysis, the research notes, the market scans — suffers from a subtler failure. It offers perspective without obligation. It analyzes without concluding. It critiques without consequence. It may feel informative and sound credible. But when the moment arrives to decide, commit, or defend a position, it rarely helps. Opinion is abundant. Clarity under uncertainty is not.

The system does not move in fragments, and decisions cannot rest on content that avoids judgment. The system moves through interaction between mandate, budget authority, functional cost domains, execution discipline, institutional behavior, and persistent structural forces. When those elements are misread as aligned, commitments become fragile — and leaders discover the misalignment after resources have been committed.

6pointco models the system. And when we offer direction, we assert judgment, name tradeoffs, and accept accountability for the position taken.

## What the Model Reveals — A Structural Illustration

Consider what happens when Congress enacts a cybersecurity mandate — statutory authority requiring agencies to implement zero trust architecture within defined timelines.

**Imperatives** identifies the mandate class: statutory requirement with explicit compliance deadlines, creating institutional compulsion independent of funding adequacy. **Technology** reveals that the security tower where zero trust investment must concentrate has been structurally underfunded relative to mandate growth for three consecutive fiscal years. **Practices** exposes the execution gap: federal acquisition timelines for security architecture contracts average 18–24 months, but the continuing resolution funding those acquisitions authorizes only 12 months of obligation. **Enterprise** documents the institutional response: agencies report compliance milestones against strategic plans while actual execution stalls at the procurement stage. **Industry** shows vendors positioning product suites against the mandate language, concentrating revenue exposure on authority that has not yet been matched with enacted appropriations. **Forces** confirms that workforce scarcity in federal cybersecurity compounds every layer — the mandate exists, the funding lags, the acquisition crawls, the institution adapts its reporting, and the market prices in demand that execution capacity cannot absorb.

No single fragment of this picture is wrong. But any fragment read in isolation supports a decision that the full structural interaction would contradict. That is the problem this model exists to solve.

## The Layered Model

Federal technology operates across six interacting layers. Each represents a distinct analytical stance — a way of entering the system based on the question you carry.

### Imperatives

Authoritative mechanisms — appropriations legislation, statutory mandates, executive directives — compel institutional action across agencies. Enacted authority governs behavior. Proposals, messaging, and strategic plans do not. Imperatives define constraint — the boundary conditions within which all other decisions are made.

### Technology

Capability and cost are structured through functional domains. Resources aggregate in technology towers — applications, compute, security, network — not in agency wish lists or vendor portfolios. Technology analysis examines where resources concentrate, where modernization pressure accumulates, and where underinvestment becomes structurally visible.

### Practices

Technology does not implement itself. Portfolio strategy, budget formulation, acquisition execution, architecture governance, implementation oversight, and operations management determine whether mandates and funding translate into outcomes. Practices are the execution mechanics that connect authority to operational capability.

### Enterprise

Institutions behave under constraint. Governance structures, portfolio allocation patterns, risk posture, and tradeoff decisions reveal how federal organizations actually respond to the pressures placed on them — not how their strategic plans suggest they will. Enterprise analysis is about institutional behavior, not document description.

### Industry

Suppliers do not operate independently in the federal market. Vendor positioning, competitive structure, revenue concentration, and strategic adaptation are structurally derived from mandate architecture and institutional demand. When appropriations compress, vendor strategy must adapt. Industry analysis examines that adaptation.

### Forces

Persistent systemic dynamics shape outcomes across all layers independent of discrete mandates. Fiscal compression, oversight escalation, workforce scarcity, vendor lock-in, political volatility — these are structural physics that operate regardless of administration, regardless of policy cycle, and regardless of institutional intent.

## Depth of Insight

Not every question requires prescription. Not every artifact carries the same analytical weight.

We publish work at increasing depth. Structural explanation establishes shared vocabulary and institutional mechanics. Evidence assembly documents what is enacted, allocated, and executed — fact without interpretation. System diagnosis identifies where mandate, funding, and execution structurally diverge — interpretation grounded in evidence. Role-specific direction translates diagnosis into guidance for defined actors — prescription grounded in diagnosis.

This progression is deliberate. Evidence precedes interpretation. Interpretation precedes prescription. When we offer direction, it rests on demonstrated structural analysis — and it states its assumptions, acknowledges its tradeoffs, and accepts that conditions may change.

## Evidence-First Discipline

We operate under a strict analytical progression.

Structural clarity precedes commentary. Enacted authority precedes narrative. Evidence precedes interpretation. Interpretation precedes prescription.

Rhetoric is excluded from analysis. Budget requests describe intent. Appropriations acts describe constraint. Policy speeches describe aspiration. Execution data describes reality. We anchor to what is enacted and documented — not to what is proposed or promised.

Every structural claim must be traceable to a source, an entity, an allocation pattern, or a documented constraint. If it cannot be traced, it does not belong.

## What We Sell — And What We Don't

Much of the paid content available to federal technology leaders offers perspective without obligation. It analyzes without concluding. It critiques without accepting consequence. The reader may feel informed, but the content rarely compresses a decision.

We operate on a different principle: if content does not force a decision, it should not extract value.

Structural explanation, evidence assembly, and ecosystem commentary are published openly. Context and institutional literacy belong in the public layer. They are not products — and placing them behind a paywall would misrepresent what they are. Free access is not a teaser. It is a boundary.

We charge for decision-grade work. Strategic Memoranda that define an actor, state a structural diagnosis, assert direction, acknowledge tradeoffs, and declare the conditions under which the guidance would fail. Analysis Memoranda that diagnose structural misalignment with a clear thesis — defensible, challengeable, and grounded in documented evidence.

The standard for any paid artifact is whether it changes what the reader would do. Commentary that confirms existing understanding does not meet that standard. Governed judgment — with assumptions named, consequences modeled, and accountability accepted — does.

## Accountability

When we issue strategy, it carries obligation.

Assumptions are stated explicitly. Tradeoffs are acknowledged — what is gained and what is sacrificed. Risk is accepted — not hidden behind hedged language. And reassessment is anticipated — because structural conditions change, and guidance must evolve with them.

Strong positions are permitted when they are traceable to enacted authority, structurally reasoned, transparent about assumptions, and willing to be revisited. Reassessment is a feature of intellectual maturity, not a sign of weakness. When we revisit prior guidance, that strengthens authority — it does not undermine it.

## What We Are Not

We are not a contract intelligence dashboard. We do not track awards for opportunity alerts.

We are not a document repository. We do not aggregate artifacts without interpretation.

We are not a policy commentary outlet. We do not react to headlines or amplify rhetoric.

We are not a technology trend blog. We do not chase novelty cycles.

We are not a consulting firm selling labor. We do not provide bespoke advisory engagements.

We provide systems-level institutional analysis grounded in enacted authority, functional cost structure, and execution mechanics — for leaders who need structural clarity before allocating resources, credibility, or capital.

## How to Use This Platform

Enter through the question you carry.

What mandate is shaping the environment? Start with Imperatives. How is funding structured within a technology domain? Start with Technology. Where is execution breaking down? Start with Practices. How is a specific institution behaving under constraint? Start with Enterprise. How are suppliers adapting? Start with Industry. What persistent pressures are shaping trajectory? Start with Forces.

Move from structure to evidence to diagnosis to direction. The system is visible. The interactions are traceable. The implications are examined. And when the work reaches the level of strategy, it will tell you what it thinks you should do — and why.
