The Technology perspective examines functional technology domains through which capability and cost are structured across the federal enterprise.

Federal technology spending is not organized by agency wish list or vendor portfolio. It is organized by functional cost domains — what the Technology Business Management framework calls towers. Applications, compute, storage, network, security, end-user services — these are the structural categories where resources aggregate, where modernization pressure accumulates, and where underinvestment becomes visible.

This perspective does not examine who buys — that belongs to Enterprise. It does not examine who sells — that belongs to Industry. It examines where resources concentrate, how capability is categorized, and where allocation patterns create structural tension.

The primary organizing taxonomy is TBM Tower.

## Depth Progression

### Overview

Structural explanation of tower architecture — what each functional domain encompasses, how federal technology capability is categorized, and how cost aggregates across the enterprise.

### Research

Evidence on allocation patterns. Tower-level funding comparisons, spending trajectories across domains, cross-agency allocation distribution, and enacted-versus-requested investment data.

### Analysis

Diagnosis of investment misalignment. Where mandates require capability in towers that are structurally underfunded. Where allocation inertia concentrates spending in legacy domains while modernization requirements grow elsewhere.

### Strategy

Role-specific portfolio guidance. How CIOs should reallocate within tower constraints. How vendors should position against functional demand shifts. How investment decisions should be sequenced under fiscal compression.

## Taxonomy Context

Technology analysis is organized by TBM Tower — functional cost and capability domains that structure federal IT spending. Major towers include Applications, Compute, Storage, Network, Security, and End-User. Each tower represents a durable structural category independent of vendor or agency identity.

## Cross-Layer Signals

Technology allocation is directly constrained by Imperatives — enacted appropriations define what can be funded. Allocation patterns shape Practices by determining which life-cycle functions face resource pressure. Tower-level investment decisions influence Enterprise behavior and define the demand structure that Industry responds to.
