The Practices perspective examines the business processes required to manage the full life-cycle of technology within and across federal enterprises.

Technology does not implement itself. Between enacted authority and operational capability stands a chain of execution disciplines — portfolio strategy, budget formulation, acquisition execution, architecture governance, implementation oversight, operations management, and refresh planning. These processes determine whether mandates and funding translate into outcomes or stall in procedural friction.

This perspective does not examine what is funded — that belongs to Technology. It does not examine institutional governance posture — that belongs to Enterprise. It examines the execution mechanics that connect authority to outcome.

The primary organizing taxonomy is Technology Life-Cycle Function.

## Depth Progression

### Overview

Structural explanation of life-cycle functions — how federal technology moves from strategy through acquisition, implementation, operations, and retirement. The process architecture that connects mandate to outcome.

### Research

Evidence on execution patterns. Acquisition cycle timelines, CPIC process data, governance compliance rates, implementation milestone documentation, and contract execution metrics.

### Analysis

Diagnosis of execution friction. Where life-cycle processes break down under constraint — acquisition timelines that exceed authority windows, governance requirements that consume capacity without improving outcomes, budget formulation disconnected from execution reality.

### Strategy

Role-specific execution reform guidance. How agency leadership should restructure acquisition approaches under fiscal constraint. Where process simplification creates the highest execution yield. How governance reform should be sequenced to avoid disruption.

## Taxonomy Context

Practices analysis is organized by Technology Life-Cycle Function — the stages through which technology is managed from conception to retirement. Canonical functions include Strategy & Portfolio Design, Budget & Justification, Acquisition & Procurement, Implementation & Deployment, Operations & Maintenance, and Refresh & Retirement.

## Cross-Layer Signals

Practices are directly constrained by Technology allocation — resource availability determines which life-cycle functions can execute effectively. Practices outcomes shape Enterprise performance and institutional risk posture. Execution friction in Practices is amplified by Forces — workforce scarcity degrades acquisition capacity, fiscal compression shortens planning horizons.
