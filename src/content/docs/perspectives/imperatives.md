title: Imperatives
description: Cross-agency authoritative mechanisms that compel institutional action.
---

The Imperatives perspective examines cross-agency authoritative mechanisms that compel institutional action.

Federal institutions do not move voluntarily. They move because enacted authority requires it — or because fiscal constraint prevents alternatives. Appropriations legislation, statutory mandates, executive directives, OMB circulars, and government-wide regulatory requirements constitute the forcing functions of the federal technology ecosystem.

This perspective distinguishes enacted authority from proposal. Budget requests, policy speeches, and strategic plans describe intent. Appropriations acts, reconciliation legislation, and continuing resolutions describe constraint. Institutional behavior follows constraint.

Imperatives analysis does not examine how institutions respond — that belongs to Enterprise. It does not examine how execution unfolds — that belongs to Practices. It examines what compels action and what defines the boundaries within which all other decisions are made.

The primary organizing taxonomy is Mandate Class.

## Depth Progression

### Overview

Structural explanation of mandate mechanics — how appropriations architecture works, what continuing resolutions constrain, how statutory authority interacts with fiscal authority, and where regulatory requirements create cross-agency obligation.

### Research

Evidence on enacted authority and allocation. Statutory text extraction, cross-agency allocation summaries, request-versus-enacted comparisons, PPA-level constraint documentation, and CR impact quantification.

### Analysis

Diagnosis of structural misalignment between mandates and funding. Where enacted authority requires capability that enacted funding cannot support. Where fiscal constraint creates institutional tension across layers. Cross-layer integration of authority, allocation, and execution capacity.

### Strategy

Role-specific guidance under mandate pressure. How agency CIOs should position portfolios given enacted authority. How vendor executives should interpret authority compression. How oversight bodies should calibrate expectations against structural reality.

## Taxonomy Context

Imperatives are organized by Mandate Class — the type of authoritative forcing function at issue. Canonical classes include statutory mandates, appropriations constraints, executive directives, and regulatory requirements. Each defines a distinct form of institutional compulsion.

## Cross-Layer Signals

Imperatives define the boundary conditions for the entire system. Enacted appropriations constrain Technology allocation. Statutory mandates shape Practices requirements. Authority compression forces Enterprise tradeoff decisions. Funding structure influences Industry positioning. Mandate instability amplifies Forces already present in the system.
