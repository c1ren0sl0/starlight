## Mandate. Allocation. Execution. Institutional Behavior.

Federal IT decisions fail when authority, funding, and execution are misread as aligned. Enacted appropriations diverge from statutory mandates. Tower allocations lag mandate pressure by years. Execution timelines exceed the fiscal windows that authorize them. Institutional governance masks the resulting risk until resources are already committed.

A modernization program funded under a continuing resolution cannot execute multi-year architecture reform — but oversight will measure it as if it could. A zero trust mandate without corresponding appropriations creates compliance obligation without execution capacity. These are not hypothetical failures. They are the structural conditions under which federal technology operates today.

Most platforms track fragments of this system. We model the interaction — so that leaders allocating resources, credibility, or capital can see structural misalignment before they commit.

## What Happens When the System Is Misread

Portfolios are built on proposed funding that was never enacted. Modernization commitments are anchored to authority that expires before execution completes. Vendor strategies are positioned against demand signals that mandate architecture has already invalidated. Oversight expectations are calibrated to plans rather than structural capacity.

These are not edge cases. They are the predictable consequence of reading the federal technology ecosystem in fragments rather than as a system.

The institutional cost is concrete: programs collapse mid-execution, modernization cycles are wasted, vendor revenue strands against shifting authority, oversight overreaches against structurally infeasible expectations, and portfolio inertia compounds across fiscal years until correction becomes disruptive rather than routine.

## Who This Is For

For federal CIOs navigating enacted constraint — not proposed intent.
For vendor executives positioning under authority compression — not market narrative.
For oversight leaders calibrating expectation against structural capacity — not institutional aspiration.
For institutional strategists who need to distinguish what is enacted from what is announced.

## Current Structural Focus

**FY2026 Federal Appropriations — Structural Misalignment Analysis**
*Imperatives · Analysis Memorandum*

Three years of continuing resolutions followed by a hybrid enacted year create a federal technology funding architecture defined by constraint, not choice. This analysis diagnoses where mandate requirements and enacted authority structurally diverge.

*Imperatives · Overview*

The structural mechanics of FY2026 enacted authority — full-year continuing resolution baseline, hybrid appropriations, reconciliation overlay, and PPA constraint architecture.

## Systems Model Overview

Federal technology operates across six interacting layers. Each represents a distinct way of entering the system.

## Depth Progression Signal

Insight here progresses deliberately. Structural explanation establishes shared vocabulary. Evidence assembly documents what is enacted and allocated. System diagnosis identifies where mandate, funding, and execution diverge. Role-specific direction translates diagnosis into guidance for defined actors. When strategy appears, it rests on demonstrated structural analysis.

We publish structural explanation and evidence openly — because context and literacy should never sit behind a paywall. We charge only for decision-grade work: artifacts that assert judgment, force tradeoffs, and accept accountability. Free access is not a teaser. It is a boundary.

## What Structural Clarity Prevents

Misreading proposed funding as enacted authority. Building acquisition timelines that exceed fiscal authorization windows. Positioning vendor strategy against demand signals already invalidated by mandate change. Over-indexing governance reforms that do not increase execution capacity. Confusing modernization aspiration with structural feasibility.

## Positioning

6pointco is a structural interpreter of federal technology systems. We diagnose where authoritative mandates, funding architecture, execution mechanics, and institutional behavior diverge — and what that divergence means for leaders making commitments within the ecosystem.

We do not comment on events. We do not repackage announcements. We do not sell opinions or trend commentary. We decompose systems, diagnose structural misalignment, and — when the evidence supports it — offer accountable, role-specific direction.

Federal technology modernization depends on predictable authority, coherent funding, and disciplined execution. We examine where those elements align — and where they diverge.
